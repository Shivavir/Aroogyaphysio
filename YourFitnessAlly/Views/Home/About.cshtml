            <blockquote class="fst-italic text-muted">“Yoga found me when I needed myself the most.”</blockquote>
            <p>My name is <strong>Roshni Joshi</strong>, and I come from a quiet corner of India where life is often simple, but the heart carries unseen storms.</p>
            <p>Back in 2019, I was not the version of myself you see today. I was tired, emotionally fragile, and constantly battling a storm inside me that no one else could see. I smiled on the outside—but deep within, I was aching for peace, strength, and clarity. I didn’t need a workout—I needed healing.</p>
            <p>One day, I sat on a thin yoga mat—not to become flexible or to get fit—but just to breathe. That one breath changed everything.</p>
            <p><em>Yoga didn’t just stretch my muscles. It stretched my mind.<br />It didn’t just make me stronger. It made me whole.</em></p>
            <p>Slowly, I started to rise. Not in the way of the world, but within myself. I learned to sit with silence. To befriend pain. To listen to my body when it whispered before it had to scream. To forgive my past and fall in love with the present.</p>
            <p>And I promised myself—if this path can change my life, I will make it my mission to help others change theirs.</p>
            <p>Today, I help women who feel unseen, unheard, and overwhelmed—just like I once did. Whether it’s back pain, anxiety, post-pregnancy healing, or emotional burnout—you are not alone. Your journey is sacred, and I’m here to guide you gently, with honesty and love.</p>
            <p><strong>Yoga is not about the perfect pose. It’s about coming home to yourself.</strong></p>
            <p>If you’re ready to feel alive again, if you're tired of feeling stuck—come join me on the mat. We’ll rise together.</p>
